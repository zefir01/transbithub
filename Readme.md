# TransBitHub crypto exchange
Many years ago I developed this exchange. This project has long been closed.


The exchange had many unique features. Such as:
+ Deep integration with the Lightning Network (LN), which reduced transaction costs to almost zero, and in some cases to zero.
+ Low trust mechanism. Users do not need to trust the exchange with amounts for more than one transaction. There is no need to keep a large deposit on the exchange. Using LN channels makes it possible to transfer money only at the time of the transaction. For other exchanges of that time, the time and financial costs of transactions were approximately 100 times greater. In addition, if there was collusion between two of the three parties to a transaction, fraud and loss of money were possible. My exchange prevented this.
+ Tripartite deals. The ability to buy goods for fiat with automatic conversion of payment into cryptocurrency so that the seller receives payment in cryptocurrency.
+ Promises, a mechanism for deferred transactions. The ability to block cryptocurrency and transfer it offline, through cryptographically secure “messages”. Could be used for promotions, airdrops, proof of funds, and financial transactions through instant messengers.
+ The highest level of security, deep integration with the Tor network. It was impossible to calculate the actual location of the main servers. A unique traffic balancing system was built between the regular Internet and Tor, which allowed the site to work quickly even through Tor, where the latency is 300-600ms.
+ A Telegram bot that allowed you to perform absolutely all operations via Telegram.
+ Liquidity aggregator. A script was constantly running, which collected information from other exchanges and showed the most profitable advertisements for exchange.
